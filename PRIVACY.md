# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** November 2025

## Overview

Heliosinger is committed to protecting your privacy. This application processes space weather data in real-time and converts it to audio, but does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information.

## Data Collection

**We do not collect personal information.** Heliosinger operates entirely client-side:

- All audio processing happens in your browser using the Web Audio API
- All data fetching is done directly from public NOAA APIs
- No data is sent to our servers
- No analytics or tracking services are used

## Local Storage

Heliosinger uses browser localStorage only for:

- **User Preferences**: Your audio settings (volume, background mode, notification preferences)
- **UI State**: Sidebar state (open/closed) for better user experience

All localStorage data:
- Stays on your device
- Is never transmitted anywhere
- Can be cleared at any time via browser settings
- Is optional - the app works without it

## Cookies

Heliosinger uses one cookie:
- **Sidebar State**: Stores whether the sidebar is open or closed (UI preference only)
- This cookie is set locally and never sent to any server

## External Services

### Data Sources
- **NOAA Space Weather Prediction Center**: Public API for space weather data
- **DSCOVR Observatory**: Public real-time solar wind data

All data fetching is done directly from these public APIs. We do not proxy or store this data.

### Third-Party Services
- **Google Fonts**: Used for typography (standard web font loading)
- No analytics, tracking, or advertising services

## Browser Permissions

Heliosinger may request:
- **Audio Context**: Required for Web Audio API (browser standard)
- **Notifications**: Optional, only if you enable notification alerts

All permissions are requested explicitly and can be revoked at any time through your browser settings.

## Data Processing

All data processing occurs client-side:
- Space weather data is fetched from public APIs
- Audio synthesis happens in your browser
- No data is logged, stored, or transmitted to external services

## Children's Privacy

Heliosinger does not knowingly collect information from children. Since we don't collect any personal information, this is not applicable.

## Changes to Privacy Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Changes will be posted on this page with an updated "Last Updated" date.
