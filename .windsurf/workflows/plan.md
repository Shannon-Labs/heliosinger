# Plan

1) Inspect current audio/choir pipeline to find easy quality wins (binaural mix floors, smoothing, volume defaults, unlock/start parity).

2) Implement small, safe audio improvements applied globally: raise binaural floor, align stream/dashboard defaults, add unlock fallback to dashboard.

3) Sanity check for regressions (types, build risk) and summarize.
